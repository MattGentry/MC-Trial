The online HTML5 output uses a traditional tripane format; one frame holds the navigation panes, a second frame displays search and a toolbar, and the third frame contains the topic content. Responsive output is automatically enabled, which means the content display changes automatically depending on the width of the screen. The PDF output is a user guide that includes auto-generation of a TOC, glossary, and index." SourceControlProviderType="Git" ProjectGuid="6b464f0c-7a54-424f-941c-da7d45cc7305">
